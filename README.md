# Project Registration System

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your project here. Explain what the project is about, its purpose, and any relevant information that helps users understand its significance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads) installed on your machine
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed for managing dependencies
- [Yii Framework](https://www.yiiframework.com/download) set up for your project

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohit-07zx/regs_system.git
   cd regs_system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use Composer to install the required dependencies for the project:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure the Environment**

   Ensure your environment variables are set up correctly, typically in a `.env` file.

## Database Migration

To set up the database schema, run the following command:

```bash
php yii migrate/up

This command will apply all necessary migrations to your database.

## Running the Application

Start the application using the Yii development server with the following command:

```bash
